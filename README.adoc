This library implements basic file operation such as those found in shell. Its
only dependency is POSIX. Its aims to simplify operations such as file copy,
move or recursive removal without having to spawn standard shell utility.

The reason for this library existence is because sometimes we can't rely on shell
utilities to be correctly setup such as in case our program manipulates with root
file system. There is only limited number of such programs but still they need
something like this. It should be easier in most cases to just spawn standard
shell utility thus consider if you really need this library before you start using
it.

This library currently supports this set of functionalities:
* Copy including recursive copy
* Move
* Recursive removal

NOTE: This library is UNIX only. It does not support Windows paths at the moment.
